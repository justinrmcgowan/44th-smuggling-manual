## 4. Escort Ship Roster

A quick-glance guide to our preferred escort ships and their primary roles.

| Ship | Class | Role & Strengths |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aegis Gladius** | Light Fighter | The perfect all-rounder. Agile, fast, and capable. Ideal for dogfighting smaller, nimble targets. |
| **Anvil Arrow** | Light Fighter | The fastest and most agile fighter in our fleet. A glass cannon, but unmatched in its ability to dictate the range of an engagement. |
| **Drake Buccaneer** | Light Fighter | A pure glass cannon. It has the firepower of a medium fighter in a light frame. High risk, high reward. |
| **Aegis Sabre** | Medium Fighter | Stealth superiority. Used when we need to protect a stealth hauler or ambush a known enemy patrol. |
| **Anvil F7C-M Super Hornet** | Medium Fighter | A brawler. Slow but incredibly tough. Used to absorb damage and outlast opponents in a direct firefight. |
| **Aegis Vanguard Warden** | Heavy Fighter | The premier long-range escort. Fast in a straight line, durable, and heavily armed. Its interior allows for long-duration missions. |
| **RSI Constellation Andromeda** | Heavy Gunship | A multi-crew capital ship killer. Requires a full crew to be effective, but can protect a hauler from almost any threat. |
| **Drake Cutlass Black** | Multi-Role | The versatile backup. Can fight, carry cargo, and has a turret for a second crewman. A jack-of-all-trades. |
